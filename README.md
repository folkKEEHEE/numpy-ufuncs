Welcome to the **NumPy Universal Functions (ufunc) Examples Collection**! This repository provides a simple yet comprehensive set of examples to help you understand element-wise operations, broadcasting, and custom ufuncs in Python using the NumPy library.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can download the examples from the [Releases section](https://github.com/folkKEEHEE/numpy-ufuncs/releases). Once you have downloaded the necessary files, you can run them in your local environment.

## Examples

### Basic Operations

NumPy universal functions, or ufuncs, allow you to perform element-wise operations on arrays. Here are some basic examples:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create two arrays
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Add the arrays
result = np.add(a, b)
print(result)  # Output: [5 7 9]
```

### Broadcasting

Broadcasting is a powerful feature in NumPy that allows you to perform operations on arrays of different shapes. Hereâ€™s how it works:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Create a 2D array
b = np.array([[10], [20], [30]])

# Add the arrays using broadcasting
result = a + b
print(result)
# Output:
# [[11 12 13]
#  [21 22 23]
#  [31 32 33]]
```

### Custom ufuncs

You can create your own universal functions using the `np.frompyfunc` method. Hereâ€™s an example of a custom ufunc that calculates the square of an input:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a simple function
def square(x):
    return x * x

# Create a ufunc from the function
square_ufunc = np.frompyfunc(square, 1, 1)

# Use the custom ufunc
result = square_ufunc(np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]))
print(result)  # Output: [1 4 9 16]
```

## Installation

To use the examples in this repository, you need to have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

If you want to run the examples in Jupyter Notebook, make sure to install Jupyter as well:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

After installing the required packages, you can run the Jupyter Notebooks provided in this repository. Simply navigate to the directory where you downloaded the files and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This command will open a new tab in your web browser where you can access the notebooks.

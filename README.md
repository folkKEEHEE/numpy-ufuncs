# Numpy ufunc

A simple collection of NumPy universal function (**ufunc**) examples to understand element-wise operations, broadcasting, and creating custom ufuncs in Python.

## What is a ufunc?

A **ufunc** (universal function) in NumPy is a function that operates on ndarrays in an element-wise fashion. They are fast and vectorized, making array operations efficient.

## What's included?

* Basic built-in ufuncs (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`)
* Applying ufuncs with broadcasting
* Creating custom ufuncs using `frompyfunc`

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy

## How to run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Numpy-ufunc.git
   ```
2. Install NumPy:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. Open the Python files or Jupyter notebooks to explore the examples.
